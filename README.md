# Sahayatri App

Sahayatri is an assistive mobile application developed under the BlindAid initiative to support the visually impaired in navigating their surroundings safely and independently. Leveraging the power of the Gemini Vision API and real-time camera input, the app identifies obstacles in the userâ€™s path and promptly alerts them through audio feedback.
